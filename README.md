# Faydark Adventurer Architect – Core Instructions

## 🎮 Game & Narrative Rules
- **Core Stats**: Agility, Endurance, Strength, Wisdom, Charisma.  
- **Roles**: Tank, Healer, MagicalDps, PhysicalDps.  
- **Alignment**: Hidden (−100..+100).  
  - Acts as a **steering wheel** for event surfacing, option availability, and difficulty bias.  
  - Never shown as raw numbers; narrative hints only.  

### Daily Actions
- TrainAgility, TrainEndurance, TrainStrength, TrainWisdom, TrainCharisma, Adventure, RestHeal.  
- Effectiveness varies daily based on NPCs, factions, fatigue, and environment.  

### Events
- **Ranked events**: Authored templates, **parametric**, with zone/level variants.  
- **Non-ranked events**: Mix of **flavor-only** and **mechanically impactful**.  
- Events carry **option tags** that interact with alignment.  
- Ranked events graded F → S+, with rising difficulty across chapters.  

### Chapters
- 5 arcs: Lv1–10, 10–20, 20–30, 30–40, 40–50.  
- Players may save up to 3 versions of the same character at chapter completions.  

### Legacy Mentors
- At chapter start, player chooses 2 mentors from prior clears.  
- Provide **mechanical effects**:  
  - Auras (stat multipliers).  
  - Weekly guidance (training/event boosts).  
  - Signature perk (unique passive).  
- Rare cameos, mostly mechanical.  

### Gear & Crafting
- Each class has **9 known gear sets** (3 tiers each) + **1–2 hidden sets** (recipes discovered in-chapter).  
- Gear is **slot-based**; sets can be mixed & matched.  
- Crafting occurs at **Shop events** or **between chapters**.  
- Materials are **zone-specific** (common/uncommon/rare).  
- Data-driven JSON for gear sets, recipes, and materials.

## 🌍 World Design Rules
- World = **Faydark**, IP-safe, inspired by EQ’s Faydwer but legally distinct.  
- Generate **zones, races, factions, dungeons, materials** with original naming.  
- Materials tied to **creatures/zones** for a coherent crafting economy.  
- Deliver world data as **JSON/CSV packs** under `res://Data/World/`.

## 🛠 Development Rules
- **Engine**: Godot 4.4 with .NET 8 (C#).  
- **Persistence**:  
  - **Static content**: JSON/CSV, versioned + hashed.  
  - **Player state**: Local saves (AES-GCM encrypted, LZ4 compressed, schema-migrated).  
  - **Cloud persistence**: MySQL (profiles, characters, runs, checkpoints, inventory ledger, mentors).  
  - **Sync model**: Always read/write from local. Sync to MySQL transactionally at safe points. Retries if offline.  

### Reliability
- Local saves: atomic writes + backups.  
- MySQL: append-only inventory ledger + checkpoint snapshots.  
- Deterministic runs: seeds stored in save files.  
- Migration chain ensures patch safety.  

### Workflow
- Modular, maintainable Godot C# files.  
- Versioned schemas + migrations.  
- GitHub commit-ready diffs with clear messages.
